## 21_Classes

Everything in python is an object with properties and methdos.

To create class the "class" keyword must be used, followed by the name
of the class in CamelCase.

### Inheritance

With inheritance the child class inherits methods and property of it's parent class or super class.

If the 'init()' is added to the child class, the constructor of the super class remains accessible trough the 'super()' as in 'super().__init__(<properties>)'.
The child class can ovveride inherited methods or define new ones.
